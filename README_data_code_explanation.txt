# Code & Data Explanation

#### Data
We have provided data in csv format ('dtoc.csv').

#### installing python
If are new to python then the easiest way to get up and running is to download
the anaconda distribution of python:
https://www.anaconda.com/download/

#### creating a python environment
Creating an environment should be the easiest way to ensure that you can run
our code sucessfully. To do this:
- navigate to your directory which should contain the downloaded files (.csv, .yml, .ipynb)
- open command prompt (terminal in mac)
- type: 'conda env create'
- type: 'activate DTOC' ('source activate DTOC' in mac)

#### running the script
- in command prompt type: 'jupyter notebook' (this will open in your browser)
- use the browser window to open the 'AandE_regression_modelling.ipynb'
- from here you can use the drop down menu to run the script: 'Cell - Run All'
- after this you can re-run each cell individually using: Shift + Return
